# 0x02. Minimum Operations

Interview preparation project on  __Minimum Operations__.  

The question on this project expects us to find out the minimum number of operations that it will take for a given operation to be achieved.  

We are given a file with a single character __H__   

We are asked to implement a function in python that receives an argument n, an integer.  

The solution should return the number of operations that will result in __n__ number of __H__ characters in the file.

The operations are limited to:
- Copy All: copies all characters in the file
- Paste: pastes all copied characters to the file
